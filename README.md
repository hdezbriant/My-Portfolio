# My-Portfolio

## Description

Hello!
  This is the home of my personal portfolio where I will house the projects I've worked on as well as my contact information and background. I built this page in order to begin establishing myself as a developer, and gain understanding of what goes into an effective portfolio. This is actually my first professional portfolio of any kind, so I'm excited to finally have one!
